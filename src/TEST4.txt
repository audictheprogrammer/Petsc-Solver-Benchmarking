Flop counting convention: 1 flop = 1 real number operation of type (multiply/divide/add/subtract)
                            e.g., VecAXPY() for real vectors of length N --> 2N flops
                            and VecAXPY() for complex vectors of length N --> 8N flops

Phase summary info:
   Count: number of times phase was executed
   Time and Flop: Max - maximum over all processors
                  Ratio - ratio of maximum to minimum over all processors
   Mess: number of messages sent
   AvgLen: average message length (bytes)
   Reduct: number of global reductions
   Global: entire computation
   Stage: stages of a computation. Set stages with PetscLogStagePush() and PetscLogStagePop().
      %T - percent time in this phase         %F - percent flop in this phase
      %M - percent messages in this phase     %L - percent message lengths in this phase
      %R - percent reductions in this phase
