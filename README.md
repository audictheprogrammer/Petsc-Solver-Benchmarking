# Petsc-Solver-Benchmarking

This repository is dedicated to benchmarking various linear solvers available in the Petsc scientific computing library. The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of popular linear solvers such as MUMPS, SuperLU, Strumpack, Petsc and SuiteSparse. The benchmarks are conducted using matrices sourced from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection to ensure a comprehensive evaluation environment.
